Jackal Tutorials
================

This package supplies Sphinx-based tutorial content to assist you with setting up and operating your Jackal_
mobile robot. The tutorials topics are listed in the left column, and presented in the suggested reading order.

Simulation is a logical place to start, as this is universally applicable; understanding how to effectively
operate Jackal in simulation is valuable whether you are in the testing phase on software you intend to
ultimately deploy on a real Jackal, or you do not have one and are simply exploring the platform's
capabilities.

Navigation is a reasonable follow-on, although this content is applicable to both the simulator and the real
platform.

The remainder of the subjects are more applicable to the real robot, and have to do with configuring, using,
and maintaining the platform. If you are a lab administrator rather than user, these subjects are probably
more applicable to your needs and interests.
